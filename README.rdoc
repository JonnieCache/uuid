= UUID Generator
== Forked by Jonathan Davies
== Originally by Assaf Arkin http://github.com/assaf/uuid

This fork adds the ability to generate a random fake MAC address for use in the UUID generation, when we cannot retrieve a real one. This occurs when running in certain virtual machine setups, and may occur at some other times.

Please see the original gem's github page linked above for proper information about this gem.
